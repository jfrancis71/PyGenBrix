Multiple reinforce agents initialised randomly.

Can they learn from each other (so off policy)?
What are good baselines for each?

Can use entropy regulariser to encourage diverse policies? Related to some stuff on evolution algorithms.
Entropy regulariser to encourage some random exploration? What is the tradeoff with performance?

Presumably track KL divergence of new policy/old policy. Very important.
